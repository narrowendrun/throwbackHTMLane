    <p>Before the Information Age existed, the main forms of entertainment for the people were dramas and concerts which take place either in theatres or in their local areas. Few of the leisure activities that people could do were tiring ones like fishing, playing out in the park or spending time with their friends at the beach.<br> Once technology reached certain advancements, entertainment and leisure transformed into a whole new thing. Every nook and corner in the entertainment industry, in its production and distribution areas is now ruled by digital technology! The major advantage of this is that more people can publish their work, show their talents and gain attention.<br>

Movies, TV shows, documentaries, music albums, etc. can be sent to different location in a digital format via a Blu-ray disc, pen drive, an external hard disk or any similar device.
