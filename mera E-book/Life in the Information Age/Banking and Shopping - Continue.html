    <p> Though online shopping has a lot of plus points, there are a few drawbacks associated with it.<br>
 One major drawback is the threat to the customers' personal data. Customers' accounts may be hacked by hackers even though it may not be very simple to perform. This may lead to customers' money being used or robbed by someone else or the hacker may purchase products using the customers' account.<br>
Few online shops may not be genuine and may be fraudulent ones which make the customer think that they've purchased something but do not deliver the products. Hence, the information present online becomes untrustworthy.<br>

Sometimes, the delivery of the purchased products may take a very long time that the customer becomes frustrated or annoyed, or the customer may find the products to be damaged after delivery. Apart from this, shopping websites hide a lot of costs from the customer in forms like shipping charges. This may not be expensive all the time, but they will increase the final bill amount.<br>
