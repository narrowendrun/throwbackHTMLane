    <p>Learning and teaching methods have changed a lot since the start of the Information Age. Most universities, colleges, schools and other private institutions, for teaching, make use of <em>e-learning</em>, which is also known as <em>educational technology</em>.<br> The concept of introducing ICT for educational purposes was introduced to improve the overall quality of education and the learning and teaching experiences of the individuals.<br> Right now, there are numerous applications like CAI<em> (computer-aided-instruction)</em> and CAL<em> (computer-aided-learning)</em> which support both learning and teaching.<br> Due to the introduction of ICT, students can now find information from the internet on the topics they are interested in. Students can also attend great lectures from great lecturers via video-conferencing, without having to travel large distances. Teachers can monitor the actions of their students and they can be marked/graded easily.<br> Basically, the majority of individuals at this point of time, have access to a virtual learning environment where they can get educated by delivery of lessons through videos, tutorials and other interactive materials. They can interact with others and clarify their doubt through e-mails, forums and chats. Moreover, they can get their works assessed!<br><br>
