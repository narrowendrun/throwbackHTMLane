    The impact of ICT in education has its own drawbacks. Students can copy others' work on the internet and claim it to be theirs without giving any bibliographies and could be charged for plagiarism.<br> As many people have access to the internet, anybody can publish blogs and other written material, which may be inaccurate. This inaccurate information could be used by students without analysing it properly.<br> Moreover, many educational websites charge money for their content to be accessible, even though it may have been available for free earlier. Students may even get distracted by socially unacceptable content present on the internet.<p>
