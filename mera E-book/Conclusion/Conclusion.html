    <p>Well, I can see that shiny little arc behind your head. We used to call it enlightenment back in our times!<br>
So here is the conclusion for my e-book.<br><br>
Almost every facility or service is now available online. A 100 years from now, "almost" wouldn't exist at the start of the same sentence. Simplest of things like ordering food that a person wants to eat can be done using an application on the phone, with internet connection. Though there are a few drawbacks right now, we can be very optimistic that they will evolve and maybe become perfect. Or we, the users of these services and technology, will adjust and live in a society where misuse of technology doesn't occur. However, this is very unlikely to happen.<br><br>
While considering the digital divide that exists right now, people have to share the technology and services they have to narrow the gap. What must also be considered is the way the privileged ones (the poor people who get access to latest technology) behave towards the people who have treated them equally. If anyone tries to take over advantage, the whole process will have to re-start.<br>
