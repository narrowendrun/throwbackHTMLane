    <p>When people have to meet and discuss a few things, and if they are all far away from each other, then video conferencing is done.<br> Two or more people can communicate with each other simultaneously by a two-way audio and video transmission. Video conferencing is of great use to business meetings. Besides the audio and visual transmission of meeting activities, allied videoconferencing technologies can be used to share documents and display information on whiteboards. <br>
In order for video-conferencing to take place, users need dedicated hardware equipments like webcams, microphones, speakers etc. and an internet connection which is secure and stable or, they can set up a dedicated system in their office for any official calls.<br> For all informal meetings, a simple desktop system with add-ons like webcam and speakers is enough.<br>
Apart from this, video conferencing has a lot of social and institutional impacts.<br> Few examples of these are- deaf, hard-of-hearing and mute individuals can communicate with each other using sign language; witnesses can be testified via video conferencing; students can attend guest lectures from guest lecturers who are in a distant land; and real-time telemedicine and tele nursing applications, such as diagnosis, consulting, transmission of medical images, etc can be done
<em> Skype, Cisco, Google+ Hangouts</em> are some of the many applications which allow users to communicate via video conferencing.<br>
