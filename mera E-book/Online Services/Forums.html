    <p> An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. Depending on the access level of a user or the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes visible.<br>
A discussion forum is hierarchical or tree-like in structure: a forum can contain a number of sub-forums, each of which may have several topics. Within a forum's topic, each new discussion started is called a thread, and can be replied to by as many people as you wish.<br>
Depending on the forum's settings, users can be anonymous or have to register with the forum and then subsequently in order to post messages. On most forums, users do not have to log in to read existing messages.<br>
The moderators are users of the forum who are granted access to the posts and threads of all members for the purpose of moderating discussion and also keeping the forum clean.  Moderators also answer users' concerns about the forum, general questions, as well as respond to specific complaints. A few actions that can be taken by moderators are: deleting, merging, moving, and splitting of posts and threads.<br><br>
