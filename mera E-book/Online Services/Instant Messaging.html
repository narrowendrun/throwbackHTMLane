    <p> Instant messaging is a service where people can send texts and reply to them in real time with the use of an internet connection. <br>The concept of instant messaging existed since the mid-1960s,<br> however back then, people used it as notification systems for services like printing. With the advances in technology, instant messaging took a new form during the mid-80s and 90s. A huge population of people started communicating using instant messaging services because of the availability of a steady and secure internet connection. Since the start of the second millennium, many companies have started their own messaging services, some of which are exclusive to their devices only. <br> Few such instant messaging services which are still widely used by  people all around the world, at the time of writing this e-book are, <em>Whatsapp Messenger</em>, <em>Facebook Messenger</em>, <em>Skype</em>, <em>iMessage</em>, <em>Google Hangouts</em> and <em>Yahoo!Messenger</em>.<br> As of April 2016, there are approximately 900 million active users for Facebook Messenger alone!
