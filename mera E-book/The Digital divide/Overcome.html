<p>Overcoming this divide is not an easy task. Governments and private organizations have been trying to make everyone have access to the internet and other pieces of technology.<br>
World leaders, claiming to be serious about sustainable development goals are trying their best to bring affordable and universal access to the internet in low income and least developed countries and claim that it will happen by 2020. However, other researches based on current trends show that it will be possible only by 2042.<br>
This gap must become as small as possible or even better.... non-existent. Imagine a future where one side of the world has access to driver less cars, sophisticated robotic surgeries, immersive VR equipment and so on and the other side does not have access to basic necessities like internet or computers.<br>

People should be able to access all parts of the internet without any restriction or limitation at a reasonable internet speed which is appropriate with the time and age.<br>
To end this as soon as possible, both government and private organizations have to work together. Racial and gender equality must be kept as the top priority. The business models and the usage fee must be revised so that everyone can afford it and do not get frustrated because of how slow it is.<br>
