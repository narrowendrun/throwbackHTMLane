    <p> Even if the person lives in a developed country, the exact location of his residence also is a cause for the digital divide. Suppose the individual lives in the rural area or the outer city region they may not have access to reliable network connections like hi-speed internet. These are the places where very few people live and so the service providers would hate to invest just to help a handful of people.<br>
Also, service providers do not really invest and bring new technology to poorer countries even though there are millions of people over there because most of them can't afford them even if the companies make them cheap. Hence, choosing where you live also has an effect on the digital divide.<br>
