    <p>The reason why money causes the digital divide is because technology can only be accessed if you pay for it. As technological advancements are achieved, the cost of using or buying them increases.<br>
 Basically, if you do not have money, you cannot use technology.
People in highly developed countries have the money to be equipped with the latest technologies available and can also use them properly, even though it may be misused sometimes.<br>
 However, in poor countries, people do not have access to the latest technology. What is obsolete to the developed countries could be the latest technology for the poor countries. Therefore, people get the technology that they deserve depending on the overall development of their society or their country.<br>
