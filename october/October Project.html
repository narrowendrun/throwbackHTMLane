<p id="nanox">Nano X-Ray nanoparticles are tiny particles surrounded with a soft protective layer minimizing unwanted interaction with the body and suspended in a water-based solution. In nano X-ray treatment the particle suspension is injected with a standard syringe directly into a tumour where the nano-crystals accumulate and wait for activation.</p>
<p id="nanox2">The patient that receives nano X-ray has a major advantage over a standard radiotherapy patient because during standard radiotherapy treatment the body is exposed to X-rays that react with water to produce free radicals which in turn destroy DNA and other molecular structures, killing cells. Unfortunately these free radicals destroy healthy cells just as well as cancer cells and radiotherapy is therefore limited by the healthy tissues damage.</p>
<p id="nanox3">However, in nano X-ray therapy standard X-rays activate the nano X-ray particles in the patient’s tumour. The nano-crystals are optimized to absorb more x-rays and produce many more free radicals than water damaging the tumour cells and cellular structure more severely than the surrounding healthy tissues. Nano X-ray therapy can be used to fight a wide variety of cancers and is the next step in radiotherapy treatments.</p>
